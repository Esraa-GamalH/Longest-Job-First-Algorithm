# Longest-Job-First-Algorithm
The Longest Job First (LJF) CPU scheduling algorithm is a non-preemptive scheduling approach that prioritizes longer jobs over shorter ones. In this algorithm, the CPU selects the process with the longest burst time, which is the amount of time a process requires to complete its execution, and schedules it for execution.
